# SpreadBike

# Description
SpreadBike it's a pwa ( progressive web app) created to encourage people to use bikes as their way of commuting, offering a user firendly interface where users can track their stats and visualise their trips.  The application has an integrated api that let's users search for nearby places where they can rent bikes. The app has a clever method of incentivising people to continue their good habbits of biking by offering badges that are cool milestones that a pearson can reach if they continuously use the app while biking.

# Real world applications
Our app provides a clear and simple way of tracking bike trips and gamifying them. Offers the users a better experiece when going on biking trips or just commuting.

# Technologies
We created the app using MERN stack. We used react to design and build the frontend, where we also made use of mapbox gl to render trips and locate nearby bike rental places. We have a node server and a mongodb database that help with api calls and authentication.

# The future
Due to the limted time our app still has some visible bugs. We plan to fix them as soon as possible and continue developing our current features. A more stable and accurate tracking, more bike services and routinee helper would be the next focuses.
