# SpreadBike

# Description
SpreadBike is a PWA ( progressive web app) created to encourage people to use bikes as their way of commuting, offering a user friendly interface where users can track their stats and visualise their trips.  The application has an integrated API that lets users search for nearby places where they can rent bikes. The app has a clever method of incentivising people to continue their good habits of biking by offering badges that are cool milestones that a person can reach if they continuously use the app while biking.

# Real world applications
Our app provides a clear and simple way of tracking bike trips and gamifying them. Offers the users a better experience when going on biking trips or just commuting.

# Technologies
We created the app using MERN stack. We used React.js to design and build the front-end, where we also made use of Mapbox GL to render trips and locate nearby bike rental places. We also used Node.js and Express.js for the back-end and a MongoDB database that help with API calls and authentication.
